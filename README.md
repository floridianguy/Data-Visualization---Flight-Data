This project is a study of airline data for several million US flights.  
It was created as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.  
The data comes from the US Bureau of Transportation.  The focus is on cities and 
airlines that experienced cancellations and delays.  I found that there are variables 
that a travel insurer might find useful for pricing policies and other variables 
that are less useful.

The project makes use of dictionary comprehensions, list comprehensions, and a variety 
of standard python methods such as 'apply' and 'argsort'.

Data from this project was obtained from the following website:
